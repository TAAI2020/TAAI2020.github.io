Google’s DeepMind developed a Go program, AlphaGo, that defeat the Go champion, which was thought to be not possible to happen within one or two decades. First, review Deep Reinforcement Learning (DRL). Second, classify DRL applications into three types, from board games, video games, to industrial applications. Then, present the prospective researches on DRL in the three types of DRL applications. </p>

      <p style="text-align:justify"> I-Chen Wu is a Professor at Department of Computer Science, National Chiao Tung University. He received his B.S. in Electronic Engineering from National Taiwan University (NTU), M.S. in Computer Science from NTU, and Ph.D. in Computer Science from Carnegie-Mellon University, in 1982, 1984 and 1993, respectively. <br/>
      Wu invented a new game, named Connect6, a variation of the five-in-a-row game, and presented this game in the 11th Advances in Computer Games Conference (ACG'11) in 2005. The game-tree complexity of this game is quite high, close to Chinese Chess. Since presented in 2005, Connect6 has been a tournament item in Computer Olympiad. He wrote a program, named NCTU6, and won the gold in the tournament in 2006. Up to date, there have been at least four game websites supporting this game, at least 10 web forums for this game (in Traditional Chinese, Simplified Chinese, English, Spanish and multi-lingual), hundreds of thousands games played over the Internet, several Josekis (opening moves) and Tsumegos (like puzzles) developed, and one human Connect6 open tournament held in Summer 2006.<br/>
      Wu also developed a game platform over Internet and actively participated in software development leading a team to major software components and framework in both clients and servers. In the client side, the team led by him developed a portable AWT/Swing architecture for Java game development, which has been used in some game companies including Sina Inc., Hinet, and ThinkNewIdea Inc., in Taiwan.

            <p style="text-align:justify"> The use of face for biometric recognition has been more and more popular. Face provides very convenient and high-precision biometric information for identity recognition, including verification and identification. Face recognition is one of the widely used application areas that benefit from the deep learning technology in computer vision. However, there are many technical and legal issues arisen in recent years and need to be resolved urgently. In this talk, we will focus on the technical challenges for applying face recognition models to face login on computers and mobile phones as well as physical access control in practice. These challenges include face recognition under attribute variations, large pose variations, and occlusions, as well as the fairness issue and face anti-spoofing. In addition, I will also discuss the across-model face recognition problem which is commonly encountered in practical face recognition systems and the solution. Finally, I will conclude the talk with some potential research directions. </p>
